How to push local project to github
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Open Git Bash.
Change the current working directory to your local project.
Initialize the local directory as a Git repository. ...
>$ git init
Add the files in your new local repository. ...
>$ git add .
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
>$ git commit -m "First commit"
In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
>$ git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
# Sets the new remote
$ git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
>$git push origin master


create a branch in local and track remote stable
git checkout -b stable origin/stable
git checkout -b model_cleanup origin/model_cleanup
create branch from some commit
git branch branchname <sha1-of-commit>

You can actually track more than one remote repository using git remote
git remote add mmah git@github.com:mmah/vetlearn-cms.git
git fetch mmah
git branch -a
git checkout -b mmah_stable mmah/stable
git checkout -b mmah_master mmah/master
above give you mmah as another repository
To see two branch difference
git diff --name-status master mmah_master
git diff --stat --color master..branchName
push to model only
git push origin model_cleanup

push local master to another branch with force
git push origin master:stabletest -f

To go back to a early version
# reset the index to the desired tree
git reset 56e05fced
# move the branch pointer back to the previous HEAD
git reset --soft HEAD@{1}
git commit -m "Revert to 56e05fced"
# Update working copy to reflect the new commit
git reset --hard
# go back to a given version, get sha
git reset --hard givensha
if its a local commit that you haven't pushed elsewhere, take a look at git reset, or even the --amend flag to git commit. You can undo what you've done and get on with your day. Once you've pushed that commit however, you'll want to use revert to create a new commit which rolls back your change. You should never rewrite your repository history using git reset, rebase, etc, once others have incorporated it into their local repositories.
n a court of law, events can be stricken from the record. Likewise, you can pick specific commits to undo.
$ git commit -a
$ git revert 1b6d
will undo just the commit with the given hash. The revert is recorded as a new commit, which you can confirm by running git log.
If get error, you will have to resolve the conflicts, mark them as so with git add or git rm and git commit, then push
To merge feature/1.3
git checkout dev13
git merge master
git pull --rebase
